/**
 * <p>This package provides extended implementations of the basic exception classes (Exception and RuntimeException) :<ul>
 *    <li>{@link ParametricCheckedException} includes parameters for logging or customizable error messages</li>
 *    <li>{@link ParametricRuntimeException} runtime version of the ParametricException</li>
 * </ul></p>
 * <p>The additional functionalities are :</p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li>an identifier enables to clearly identify the error</li>
 *    <li>additional data that can be used for the default error message or retrieved for error handling :<ul>
 *        <li>the creation time</li>
 *        <li>an optional collection of user-defined parameters</li>
 *    </ul></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The parametric exceptions uses the MessageFormatter from slf4j, which replaces {} by parameters.</p>
